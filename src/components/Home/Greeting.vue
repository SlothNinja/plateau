      SlothNinja Games is a play-by-web (PBW) site that permits registered members to play board
      and card games with other members in a turn-based manner. The site provides a graphical
      interface where players can see the current game state and execute their actions
      via a web browser. The site keeps track of the game state, enforces legal moves, and optionally
      sends email notifications to players when it is their turn to move.

      Registration is required in order to play. Registration is free, but requires a Google Account.
    </div>
    <div class='body-1 pb-2'>
      Due to the PBW nature of the site, games typically take days, weeks, or even months to complete
      depending on how frequently players take their turns. 
    </div>
    <div class='body-1'>
      There is a general expectation among the community that players will make
      at least one move each day. If you plan to consistently take longer than a day per move,
      please create a new game and clearly indicate your desired playing speed in the title.
